# NDAO Token Future supply and Burn

### The new tokens release process

* The new site proposal is submitted by a member of the community with details about funds needed in USD$ terms.
* New tokens are opened for sale as a part of the new contract release when new site proposals are accepted. The number of tokens released will be only to meet the fund needed for the new site + 10% buffer based on the current market price of NDAO in USD$
* First priority will be given to members of the local community investors. After a certain period, the remaining tokens will be left open for grab by the global community. This will ensure the operational cost to benefit the local community while connected to the global community.

### Existing tokens burn process

* When the physical site is decommissioned due to operational and non-compliance reasons, then the tokens released for that site will be burnt, the contract will be decommissioned hence reducing the total supply.
