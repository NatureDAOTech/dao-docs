* NatureDAO will run as a decentralized autonomous organization on blockchain outside of any Jurisdiction.
* Physical sites will be run in collaborations with a reputed registered charity or non-government organizations (NGOs) working on animal care and environmental issues in the respective countries. These are registered as not-for-profit organizations.
* This will help these charities and NGOs to sustain their efforts and also gain access to DeFis and DAOs.
* The full-time support workers needed by the physical site will be directly employed by the NGO
* Expected revenue streams on the physical site:&#x20;
  * Mining & validators reward
  * Global Carbon Credit received due to renewable and plantation
  * Training fees
* Revenue generated at the physical sites will be distributed monthly as below:&#x20;
  * 40% will go to NGO where the physical site is up and running. This will ensure the NGO has the interest to keep the site functioning at the optimum level.&#x20;
  * 60% will be deposited to the Community Revenue contract. From there the funds will be distributed as dividends to NDAO token holders as per their respective token holdings.&#x20;

For example, if we have 1000 sites running, each site will have its own contract where mining, validation, and carbon credit revenue will be collected. 40% of the particular site revenue will be transferred to the wallet of NGO running their own site. 60% percent of the revenue of all the 100 sites will be transferred to the wallet of Community Revenue automatically at the end of the month.&#x20;
