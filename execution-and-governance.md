* NatureDAO will run as a decentralized autonomous organization on multiple blockchains outside of any Jurisdiction.
* Physical sites will be run in collaborations with a reputed registered charity or non-government organizations (NGOs) working on animal care and environmental issues in the respective countries. These are registered as not-for-profit organizations.
* This will help these charities and NGOs to sustain their efforts and also gain access to DeFis and DAOs.
* The full-time support workers needed by the physical site will be directly employed by the NGO
