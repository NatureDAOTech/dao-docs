# The Promise, Problem & Solution

### The Promise of Blockchain Technology

* Decentralized finance to overcome the economic disparity in society.
* The public network nodes on which the blockchain runs should be distributed across the globe, irrespective of the economy and weather conditions of the country.

### The problem in the blockchain economy

* Blockchain minor and validators use as much energy as mining for real metals according to new research. Some reports suggest, Electricity used in Bitcoin mining surpasses the power consumption of 159 countries.
* These reports may not be 100% accurate but the truth is mining facilities are setup in colder and economically better-off countries. That sustains the same problem - centralization and economic disparity between hot & developing countries vs cold & developed countries. Note- China has suspended all mining activities due to the high consumption of fossil fuels.

### The problem in the real world

* Empty barren land where the soil is dying every day.
* Stray Cows and Bulls, dying painfully with toxic waste and road accidents.

### Solution - Self sustainable blockchain facility&#x20;
