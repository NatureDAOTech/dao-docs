# The Promise, Problem & Solution

### The Promise of Blockchain Technology

* Decentralized finance to overcome the economic disparity in society.
* The public network nodes on which the blockchain runs should be distributed across the globe, irrespective of the economy and weather conditions of the country.

### The problem in the blockchain economy

* Energy consumption by Blockchain minor and validators is the main talking point of Cryptocurrency critics.&#x20;
* Reports explaining insane energy use by miners may not be 100% accurate but the truth is mining facilities are set up in colder and economically better-off countries. That sustains the same problem - centralization and economic disparity between hot & developing countries vs cold & developed countries. Note- China has suspended all mining activities due to the high consumption of fossil fuels.

### The problem in the real world

* Empty barren land where the soil is dying every day.
* Stray Cows and Bulls, dying painfully with toxic waste and road accidents.

### Solution - Self sustainable blockchain facility&#x20;

Connect with NGO or Charity that has land and&#x20;

* Permaculture plantation with rainwater harvesting
* Build cow shed with solar panel roof and bring in stray cows
* Build BioGas electricity generation plant designed by Aisin-Japan. [https://aisinindia.com/bio-gas](https://aisinindia.com/bio-gas)&#x20;
* Build blockchain mining and validators facility
* Blockchain and nature preservations training facility for the local community
