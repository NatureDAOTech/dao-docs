# Pilot Project Site

### Current state

* Pilot site update page - TODO - Add link to Pilot site status page on Nature DAO website
* 28 acres of land is acquired by the NGO in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra State of India
* 7 rainwater harvesting pond and big well is dug to source water all year around

### Why Pilot in India?

* India has one of the largest portions of land which is degrading due to climate change, chemical farming, and lack of funding
* India also has one of the largest stray cows dying daily on streets due to harmful plastic and toxic waste and road accidents
* India produces the worlds largest numbers of software engineers every year, many of them have no jobs
* India has the cheapest and pretty fast mobile internet availability due to very highly competitive industry

### After Pilot success

* Run the project sites across India, South Asia, Africa, South America
* Multiple sites setup up across the world will bring economic sustainability for the DAO and steady returns for NDAO token holders
